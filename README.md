Astrid.Framework
================

Astrid is a C# component based cross-platform game framework for rapid development of mobile games. It works by allowing you to develop 
on Windows and easily port to Android or iOS later.

## Looking for developers to join the project!
 
 Although the framework has all the basics needed to build a game, there's still a lot of work to do.
 If you're a game developer and you're looking to contribute to an open source project, nows your chance! 
 It'll look great on your resume (or linkedin profile) and it'll give you something to blog about.

 We need to get the framework onto different platforms.  I'm esspecially interested if you're already doing Xamarin iOS development.
 
## How it works

Astrid uses portable class libraries to share code between platforms. This greatly increases the code reuse and multi-platform compatibility 
by providing a clear separation between game code and platform specific code.
