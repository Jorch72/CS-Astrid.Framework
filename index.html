            <h1>Astrid Game Framework</h1>
            <p>
                Astrid is a C# game-development framework designed to speed up game development of mobile games
                by allowing most of the development to happen on the desktop using the same code base.

            <h2><i class="fa fa-android"></i> Cross Platform</h2>
            <p>
                Built from the ground up as a multi-platform architecture. Develop your game on the desktop, then quickly port it to
                other platforms with only a few lines of code.

                The source code is hosted on github and licensed under the MIT license.
                Basically, you can do whatever you want as long as you include the original copyright and licenses in their respective sources.

            <h2><i class="fa fa-cogs"></i> Portable &amp; Extensible</h2>
            <p>
                The core framework is built using Portable Class Libraries (PCL). This makes it easy to write your own extensions without
                having to worry about compiling it for each supported platform.

            <h2><i class="fa fa-plug"></i> Entities &amp; Components</h2>
            <p>
                The framework comes with a powerful entity component engine. Compose game objects and scenes using built-in components and
                systems, or create your own.

            <p>
                Astrid is programmer friendly, it sits in between a full blown game engine and a low level framework.
                We've already done the heavy lifting to add physics and particle effects, or you can roll your own if
                you prefer.

                Currently in development is a powerful scene editor for creating great looking GUI's and levels for your games.
