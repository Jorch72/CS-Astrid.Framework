# Astrid Game Framework

[![Build Status](http://build.craftworkgames.com/app/rest/builds/buildType:(id:AstridFramework_CiBuild)/statusIcon)](http://build.craftworkgames.com/viewType.html?buildTypeId=AstridFramework_CiBuild&guest=1)

[Astrid](http://astrid.craftworkgames.com/) is a C# game-development framework designed to speed up game development of mobile games by allowing most of the development to happen on the desktop using the same code base. It works by allowing you to develop games on Windows and use the same code base on Android or iOS later with very little effort.

## How it works

Astrid uses portable class libraries to share code between platforms. This greatly increases the code reuse and multi-platform compatibility by providing a clear separation between game code and platform specific code.

## Looking for developers to join the project!
 
Although the framework has all the basics needed to build a game, there's still a lot of work to do. If you're a game developer and you're looking to contribute to an open source project, nows your chance! It'll look great on your resume (or linkedin profile) and it'll give you something to blog about.

We need to get the framework onto different platforms.  I'm esspecially interested if you're already doing Xamarin iOS development.

Head on over to the [Trello](https://trello.com/b/egogxXto/astrid-game-framework) board to see what we are currently working on.

## Getting started

The framework is distrubuted as a collection of [NuGet packages](http://astrid.craftworkgames.com/Home/Downloads).

There's also a [Hello World tutorial](blog.craftworkgames.com/getting-started-with-astrid) on the blog.

Or you can take a look at the [Samples](https://github.com/craftworkgames/AstridSamples) repository.

## Supported Platforms

* Windows
* Android

We would like to support more platforms, particularly mobile devices. If you're interested in contributing please contact me [@craftworkgames](https://twitter.com/craftworkgames) or submit an issue right here on github.
