Astrid.Framework
================

Astrid is a C# component based cross-platform game framework for rapid development of mobile games. It works by allowing you to develop on Windows and easily port to Android or iOS later.

**The project is currently in development and does not fully support all platforms.**


## How it works

Astrid uses portable class libraries to share code between platforms. This greatly increases the code reuse and multi-platform compatibility by providing a clear separation between game code and platform specific code.
