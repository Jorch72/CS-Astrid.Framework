# Astrid Game Framework

## No longer under active development

Astrid is an **experimental** C# game-development framework inspired by [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/). I wrote it from scratch between January and April 2015. Technically the project was a success, proving that a cross-platform game framework can be made with 90% of the code in [Portable Class Libararies](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/gg597391(v=vs.100).aspx). Unfortunately, after 5 months of active development I found it very difficult to get traction and decided to focus my energy into [helping other game developers](http://dylanwilson.net/) instead.

## How it works

The framework is designed to speed up game development of mobile games by allowing most of the development to happen on the desktop using the same code base. It works by allowing you to develop games on Windows and use the same code base on Android or iOS later with very little effort.

Astrid uses portable class libraries to share code between platforms. This greatly increases the code reuse and multi-platform compatibility by providing a clear separation between game code and platform specific code.

## Supported Platforms
