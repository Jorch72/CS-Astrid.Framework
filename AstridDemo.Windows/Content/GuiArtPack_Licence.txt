## Basic Licence

The Basic Licence allows you to use the asset in a personal game, or a game that is released for free and is not monetized. This 
licence is not exclusive.

This makes the Basic Licence the perfect choice for learning and game jams, as well as for any project that does not make you 
financial income.
